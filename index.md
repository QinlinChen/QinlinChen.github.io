## About

I am studying for a Ph.D. degree in the [Pascal Research Group][pascal] at Nanjing University. I am supervised by [Yue Li][yueli] (李樾). I have my interest in programming languages, software reliability methods, and infrastructure systems. Currently I am focusing on applying modern PL&SE techniques to hardware descrpition languages.

## Projects

- [snap2exe](https://github.com/QinlinChen/snap2exe)
  - snap2exe aims to generate an ELF executable from a run-time snapshot of a process so that user can continue that process from where it was snapshoted by simply executing the genereated executable. It looks cool, so I implement it for fun.
